/**
 * An util class to start a local Delta Connect server in a different process for local E2E tests.
 * Pre-running the tests, the Delta Connect artifact needs to be built using e.g. `build/sbt
 * assembly`. It is designed to start the server once but shared by all tests. It is equivalent to
 * use the following command to start the connect server via command line:
 *
 * {{{
 * bin/spark-shell \
 * --jars `ls spark-connect/server/target/**/delta-connect-server-assembly*SNAPSHOT.jar | paste -sd ',' -` \
 * --conf spark.plugins=org.apache.spark.sql.connect.SparkConnectPlugin
 * --conf spark.sql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension
 * --conf spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog
 * }}}
 *
 * Set system property `delta.test.home` or env variable `DELTA_HOME` if the test is not executed
 * from the Delta project top folder.
