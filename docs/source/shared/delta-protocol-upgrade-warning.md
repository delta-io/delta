.. warning::
   Protocol version upgrades are irreversible, and upgrading the protocol version may break the existing <Delta> table readers, writers, or both. Therefore, we recommend you upgrade specific tables only when needed, such as to opt-in to new features in <Delta>. You should also check to make sure that all of your current and future production tools support <Delta> tables with the new protocol version.
