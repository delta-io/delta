# Read Delta Sharing Tables

[Delta Sharing](https://delta.io/sharing/) is an open protocol for secure real-time exchange of large datasets, which enables 
organizations to share data in real time regardless of which computing platforms they use. 
It is a simple REST protocol that securely grants access to part of a cloud dataset and leverages 
modern cloud storage systems, such as S3, ADLS, GCS or R2, to reliably transfer data.

In Delta Sharing, data provider is the one who owns the original dataset or table, and shares it with a broad range of recipients. 
Each table can be configured to be shared with different options (history, filtering, etc.) We will focus on consuming the shared table in this doc.

Delta Sharing data source supports most of the options provided by <AS> DataFrame for performing reads through [batch](delta-batch.md), [streaming](delta-streaming.md), or [table changes (CDF)](delta-change-data-feed.md) APIs on shared tables.
Delta Sharing doesn't support writing to a shared table. Please refer to the [Delta Sharing Repo](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing/blob/main/README.md) for more details. 
Please follow the [quick start](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start) to leverage the Delta Sharing python connector to discover the shared tables.  

For Delta Sharing reads on shared tables with advanced <Delta> features such as [Deletion Vectors](delta-deletion-vectors.md) and [Column Mapping](delta-column-mapping.md), 
you need to enable integration with <AS> DataSourceV2 and Catalog APIs (since delta-sharing-spark 3.1) by setting the same configurations as <Delta> when you create a new `SparkSession`. See [_](delta-batch.md#sql-support).

## Read a snapshot
After you save the [Profile File](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md#profile-file-format) locally and launch Spark with the connector library, you can access shared tables.
A profile file is provided by the data provider to the data recipient. 

.. code-language-tabs::

  ```SQL
  -- A table path is the profile file path followed by `#` and the fully qualified name 
  -- of a table (`<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>`).
  CREATE TABLE mytable USING deltaSharing LOCATION '<profile-file-path>#<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>';
  SELECT * FROM mytable;
  ```
  ```python
  # A table path is the profile file path followed by `#` and the fully qualified name 
  # of a table (`<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>`).
  table_path = "<profile-file-path>#<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>"
  df = spark.read.format("deltaSharing").load(table_path)
  ```
  ```scala
  // A table path is the profile file path followed by `#` and the fully qualified name 
  // of a table (`<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>`).
  val tablePath = "<profile-file-path>#<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>"
  val df = spark.read.format("deltaSharing").load(tablePath)
  ```
  ```java
  // A table path is the profile file path followed by `#` and the fully qualified name 
  // of a table (`<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>`).
  String tablePath = "<profile-file-path>#<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>";
  Dataset<Row> df = spark.read.format("deltaSharing").load(tablePath);
  ```

The DataFrame returned automatically reads the most recent snapshot of the table for any query. 

Delta Sharing supports [predicate pushdown](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md#json-predicates-for-filtering) to efficiently fetch data from the Delta Sharing server when there are applicable predicates in the query.

## Query an older snapshot of a shared table (time travel)

Once the data provider enables history sharing of the shared table, Delta Sharing time travel allows you to query an older snapshot of a shared table.

.. code-language-tabs::

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM mytable TIMESTAMP AS OF timestamp_expression
  SELECT * FROM mytable VERSION AS OF version
  ```
  ```python
  spark.read.format("deltaSharing").option("timestampAsOf", timestamp_string).load(tablePath)

  spark.read.format("deltaSharing").option("versionAsOf", version).load(tablePath)
  ```
  ```scala
  spark.read.format("deltaSharing").option("timestampAsOf", timestamp_string).load(tablePath)

  spark.read.format("deltaSharing").option("versionAsOf", version).load(tablePath)
  ```

The `timestamp_expression` and `version` share the same syntax as [Delta](delta-batch.md#timestamp-and-version-syntax).

## Read Table Changes (CDF)

Once the data provider turns on CDF on the original <Delta> table and shares it with history through Delta Sharing, the recipient can query CDF of a Delta Sharing table similar to [CDF of a Delta table](delta-change-data-feed.md).

.. code-language-tabs::

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE mytable USING deltaSharing LOCATION '<profile-file-path>#<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>';
  
  -- version as ints or longs e.g. changes from version 0 to 10
  SELECT * FROM table_changes('mytable', 0, 10)
  
  -- timestamp as string formatted timestamps
  SELECT * FROM table_changes('mytable', '2021-04-21 05:45:46', '2021-05-21 12:00:00')
  
  -- providing only the startingVersion/timestamp
  SELECT * FROM table_changes('mytable', 0)
  ```
  ```python
  table_path = "<profile-file-path>#<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>"
  
  # version as ints or longs
  spark.read.format("deltaSharing") \
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true") \
    .option("startingVersion", 0) \
    .option("endingVersion", 10) \
    .load(tablePath)
  
  # timestamps as formatted timestamp
  spark.read.format("deltaSharing") \
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true") \
    .option("startingTimestamp", '2021-04-21 05:45:46') \
    .option("endingTimestamp", '2021-05-21 12:00:00') \
    .load(tablePath)
  
  # providing only the startingVersion/timestamp
  spark.read.format("deltaSharing") \
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true") \
    .option("startingVersion", 0) \
    .load(tablePath)
  ```

  ```scala
  val tablePath = "<profile-file-path>#<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>"

  // version as ints or longs
  spark.read.format("deltaSharing")
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true")
    .option("startingVersion", 0)
    .option("endingVersion", 10)
    .load(tablePath)

  // timestamps as formatted timestamp
  spark.read.format("deltaSharing")
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true")
    .option("startingTimestamp", "2024-01-18 05:45:46")
    .option("endingTimestamp", "2024-01-18 12:00:00")
    .load(tablePath)
  
  // providing only the startingVersion/timestamp
  spark.read.format("deltaSharing")
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true")
    .option("startingVersion", 0)
    .load(tablePath)
  ```

## Streaming

Delta Sharing Streaming is deeply integrated with [Spark Structured Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html) through `readStream`, 
and able to connect with any sink that is able to perform `writeStream`.

Once the data provider shares a table with history, the recipient can perform a streaming query on the table.
When you load a Delta Sharing table as a stream source and use it in a streaming query, the query processes all of the data present in the shared table as well as any new data that arrives after the stream has started.

```scala
val tablePath = "<profile-file-path>#<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>"

spark.readStream.format("deltaSharing").load(tablePath)
```

Delta Sharing Streaming supports the following functionalities in the same way as Delta Streaming: [Limit input rate](delta-streaming.md#limit-input-rate), 
[Ignore updates and deletes](delta-streaming.md#ignore-updates-and-deletes), [Specify initial position](delta-streaming.md#specify-initial-position)

In addition, `maxVersionsPerRpc` is provided to decide how many versions of files are requested from the server in every Delta Sharing rpc. This is to help
reduce the per rpc workload and make the Delta sharing streaming job more stable,  
especially when many new versions have accumulated when the streaming resumes from a checkpoint. The default is 100.

.. note:: Trigger.AvailableNow is not supported in Delta Sharing Streaming. You can use Trigger.Once as a workaround, and at a proper frequency to catch up with the changes in the server.

## Read Advanced <Delta> Features in Delta Sharing
In order to support advanced <Delta> features in Delta Sharing, "Delta Format Sharing" was introduced since delta-sharing-client 1.0 and delta-sharing-spark 3.1, 
in which the actions of a shared table are returned in <Delta> format, allowing a <Delta> library to read it.

Please remember to set the spark configurations mentioned in [_](delta-batch.md#sql-support) in order to read shared tables with Deletion Vectors and Column Mapping. 

| Read Table Feature | Available since version |
| - | - |
| [Deletion Vectors](delta-deletion-vectors.md) | 3.1.0 | 
| [Column Mapping](delta-column-mapping.md) | 3.1.0 |

Batch queries can be performed as is, because it can automatically resolve the `responseFormat` based on the table features of the shared table.
An additional option `responseFormat=delta` needs to be set for cdf and streaming queries when reading shared tables with Deletion Vectors or Column Mapping enabled.

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

val spark = SparkSession
        .builder()
        .appName("...")
        .master("...")
        .config("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension")
        .config("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog")
        .getOrCreate()

val tablePath = "<profile-file-path>#<share-name>.<schema-name>.<table-name>"

// Batch query
spark.read.format("deltaSharing").load(tablePath)

// CDF query
spark.read.format("deltaSharing")
  .option("readChangeFeed", "true")
  .option("responseFormat", "delta")
  .option("startingVersion", 1)
  .load(tablePath)

// Streaming query
spark.readStream.format("deltaSharing").option("responseFormat", "delta").load(tablePath)
```
