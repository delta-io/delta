## Migrate workloads to Delta Lake

When you migrate workloads to Delta Lake, you should be aware of the following simplifications and differences compared with the data sources provided by Apache Spark and Apache Hive.

Delta Lake handles the following operations automatically, which you should never perform manually:

- **Add and remove partitions**: Delta Lake automatically tracks the set of partitions present in a table and updates the list as data is added or removed. As a result, there is no need to run `ALTER TABLE [ADD|DROP] PARTITION` or `MSCK`.
- **Load a single partition**: As an optimization, you may sometimes directly load the partition of data you are interested in. For example, `spark.read.format("parquet").load("/data/date=2017-01-01")`. This is unnecessary with Delta Lake, since it can quickly read the list of files from the transaction log to find the relevant ones. If you are interested in a single partition, specify it using a `WHERE` clause. For example, `spark.read.delta("/data").where("date = '2017-01-01'")`. For large tables with many files in the partition, this can be much faster than loading a single partition (with direct partition path, or with `WHERE`) from a Parquet table because listing the files in the directory is often slower than reading the list of files from the transaction log.

When you port an existing application to Delta Lake, you should avoid the following operations, which bypass the transaction log:

- **Manually modify data**: Delta Lake uses the transaction log to atomically commit changes to the table. Because the log is the source of truth, files that are written out but not added to the transaction log are not read by Spark. Similarly, even if you manually delete a file, a pointer to the file is still present in the transaction log. Instead of manually modifying files stored in a Delta table, always use the commands that are described in this guide.
- **External readers**: Directly reading the data stored in Delta Lake. For information on how to read Delta tables, see [read a table](/latest/apache-spark-connector/table-batch-reads-and-writes/#read-a-table).

### Example

Suppose you have Parquet data stored in a directory named `/data-pipeline`, and you want to create a Delta table named `events`.

The [first example](#save-as-delta-table) shows how to:

- Read the Parquet data from its original location, `/data-pipeline`, into a DataFrame.
- Save the DataFrame's contents in Delta format in a separate location, `/tmp/delta/data-pipeline/`.
- Create the `events` table based on that separate location, `/tmp/delta/data-pipeline/`.

The [second example](#convert-to-delta-table) shows how to use `CONVERT TO TABLE` to convert data from Parquet to Delta format without changing its original location, `/data-pipeline/`.

#### Save as Delta table

1. Read the Parquet data into a DataFrame and then save the DataFrame's contents to a new directory in `delta` format:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Python">
    ```python
    data = spark.read.format("parquet").load("/data-pipeline")
    data.write.format("delta").save("/tmp/delta/data-pipeline/")
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Create a Delta table named `events` that refers to the files in the new directory:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Python">
    ```python
    spark.sql("CREATE TABLE events USING DELTA LOCATION '/tmp/delta/data-pipeline/'")
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Convert to Delta table

You have two options for converting a Parquet table to a Delta table:

- Convert files to Delta Lake format and then create a Delta table:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="SQL">
    ```sql
    CONVERT TO DELTA parquet.`/data-pipeline/`
    CREATE TABLE events USING DELTA LOCATION '/data-pipeline/'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- Create a Parquet table and then convert it to a Delta table:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="SQL">
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE events USING PARQUET OPTIONS (path '/data-pipeline/')
    CONVERT TO DELTA events
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

For details, see [Convert a Parquet table to a Delta table](/latest/apache-spark-connector/table-utility-commands/#convert-a-parquet-table-to-a-delta-table).

## Migrate Delta Lake workloads to newer versions

This section discusses any changes that may be required in the user code when migrating from older to newer versions of Delta Lake.

### Below Delta Lake 3.0 to Delta Lake 3.0 or above

<Aside type="note">
  The Delta Lake on Spark Maven artifact has been renamed from `delta-core`
  (before 3.0) to `delta-spark` (3.0 and above).
</Aside>

### Delta Lake 2.1.1 or below to Delta Lake 2.2 or above

Delta Lake 2.2 collects statistics by default when converting a parquet table to a Delta Lake table (e.g. using the `CONVERT TO DELTA` command). To opt out of statistics collection and revert to the 2.1.1 or below default behavior, use the `NO STATISTICS` SQL API (e.g. `CONVERT TO DELTA parquet.`/path-to-table` NO STATISTICS`)

### Delta Lake 1.2.1, 2.0.0, or 2.1.0 to Delta Lake 2.0.1, 2.1.1 or above

Delta Lake 1.2.1, 2.0.0 and 2.1.0 have a bug in their DynamoDB-based S3 multi-cluster configuration implementations where an incorrect timestamp value was written to DynamoDB. This caused [DynamoDB's TTL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/TTL.html) feature to cleanup completed items before it was safe to do so. This has been fixed in Delta Lake versions 2.0.1 and 2.1.1, and the TTL attribute has been renamed from `commitTime` to `expireTime`.

If you _already_ have TTL enabled on your DynamoDB table using the old attribute, you need to disable TTL for that attribute and then enable it for the new one. You may need to wait an hour between these two operations, as TTL settings changes may take some time to propagate. See the DynamoDB docs [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/time-to-live-ttl-before-you-start.html). If you don't do this, DyanmoDB's TTL feature will not remove any new and expired entries. There is no risk of data loss.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Bash">
    ```bash
    # Disable TTL on old attribute
    aws dynamodb update-time-to-live \
      --region <region> \
      --table-name <table-name> \
      --time-to-live-specification "Enabled=false, AttributeName=commitTime"

    # Enable TTL on new attribute
    aws dynamodb update-time-to-live \
      --region <region> \
      --table-name <table-name> \
      --time-to-live-specification "Enabled=true, AttributeName=expireTime"
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Delta Lake 2.0 or below to Delta Lake 2.1 or above

When calling `CONVERT TO DELTA` on a catalog table Delta Lake 2.1 infers the data schema from the catalog. In version 2.0 and below, Delta Lake infers the data schema from the data. This means in Delta 2.1 data columns that are not defined in the original catalog table will not be present in the converted Delta table. This behavior can be disabled by setting the Spark session configuration `spark.databricks.delta.convert.useCatalogSchema=false`.

### Delta Lake 1.2 or below to Delta Lake 2.0 or above

Delta Lake 2.0.0 introduced a behavior change for [DROP CONSTRAINT](/latest/apache-spark-connector/constraints/#check-constraint). In version 1.2 and below, no error was thrown when trying to drop a non-existent constraint. In version 2.0.0 and above, the behavior is changed to throw a constraint not exists error. To avoid the error, use `IF EXISTS` construct (for example, `ALTER TABLE events DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS constraint_name`). There is no change in behavior in dropping an existing constraint.

Delta Lake 2.0.0 introduced support for [Dynamic Partition Overwrites](/latest/apache-spark-connector/table-batch-reads-and-writes/#overwrite). In version 1.2 and below, enabling dynamic partition overwrite mode in either the Spark session configuration or a `DataFrameWriter` option was a no-op, and writes in `overwrite` mode replaced all existing data in every partition of the table. In version 2.0.0 and above, when dynamic partition overwrite mode is enabled, Delta Lake replaces all existing data in each logical partition for which the write will commit new data.

### Delta Lake 1.1 or below to Delta Lake 1.2 or above

The [LogStore](https://docs.delta.io/latest/api/java/index.html) related code is extracted out from the `delta-core` Maven module into a new module `delta-storage` as part of the issue [#951](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/951) for better code manageability. This results in an additional JAR `delta-storage-<version>.jar` dependency for `delta-core`. By default, the additional JAR is downloaded as part of the `delta-core-<version>_<scala-version>.jar` dependency. In clusters where there is _no internet connectivity_, `delta-storage-<version>.jar` cannot be downloaded. It is advised to download the `delta-storage-<version>.jar` manually and place it in the Java classpath.

### Delta Lake 1.0 or below to Delta Lake 1.1 or above

If the name of a partition column in a Delta table contains invalid characters (` ,;{}()\n\t=`), you cannot read it in Delta Lake 1.1 and above, due to [SPARK-36271](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36271). However, this should be rare as you cannot create such tables by using Delta Lake 0.6 and above. If you still have such legacy tables, you can overwrite your tables with new valid column names by using Delta Lake 1.0 and below before upgrading Delta Lake to 1.1 and above, such as the following:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Python">
    ```python
    spark.read \
      .format("delta") \
      .load("/the/delta/table/path") \
      .withColumnRenamed("column name", "column-name") \
      .write \
      .format("delta") \
      .mode("overwrite") \
      .option("overwriteSchema", "true") \
      .save("/the/delta/table/path")
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Scala">
    ```scala
    spark.read \
      .format("delta") \
      .load("/the/delta/table/path") \
      .withColumnRenamed("column name", "column-name") \
      .write \
      .format("delta") \
      .mode("overwrite") \
      .option("overwriteSchema", "true") \
      .save("/the/delta/table/path")
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Delta Lake 0.6 or below to Delta Lake 0.7 or above

If you are using `DeltaTable` APIs in Scala, Java, or Python to [update](/latest/apache-spark-connector/table-deletes-updates-and-merges/) or [run utility operations](/latest/apache-spark-connector/table-utility-commands/) on them, then you may have to add the following configurations when creating the `SparkSession` used to perform those operations.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Python">
    ```python
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

    spark = SparkSession \
      .builder \
      .appName("...") \
      .master("...") \
      .config("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension") \
      .config("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog") \
      .getOrCreate()
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Scala">
    ```scala
    import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

    val spark = SparkSession
      .builder()
      .appName("...")
      .master("...")
      .config("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension")
      .config("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog")
      .getOrCreate()
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession;

    SparkSession spark = SparkSession
      .builder()
      .appName("...")
      .master("...")
      .config("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension")
      .config("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog")
      .getOrCreate();
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, you can add additional configurations when submitting you Spark application using `spark-submit` or when starting `spark-shell`/`pyspark` by specifying them as command line parameters.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Bash">
    ```bash
    spark-submit --conf "spark.sql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension" --conf "spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog" ...
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Bash">
    ```bash
    pyspark --conf "spark.sql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension" --conf "spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog" ...
    ```
  </TabItem>
