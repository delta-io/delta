# AWS Athena Delta Connector

Since Athena [version 3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/engine-versions-reference-0003.html), Athena natively supports reading Delta Lake tables. For details on using the native Delta Lake connector, see [Querying Delta Lake tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/delta-lake-tables.html). For Athena versions lower than [version 3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/engine-versions-reference-0003.html), you can use the manifest-based approach detailed in [Presto, Trino, and Athena to Delta Lake integration using manifests](/presto-integration).
