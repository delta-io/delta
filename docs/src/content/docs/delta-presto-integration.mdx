Since Presto [version 0.269](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.269/release/release-0.269.html#delta-lake-connector-changes), Presto natively supports reading Delta Lake tables. For details on using the native Delta Lake connector, see [Delta Lake Connector - Presto](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/deltalake.html). For Presto versions lower than [0.269](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.269/release/release-0.269.html#delta-lake-connector-changes), you can use the manifest-based approach detailed in [Presto, Trino, and Athena to Delta Lake integration using manifests](/presto-integration/).
