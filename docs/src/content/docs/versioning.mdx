title: How does Delta Lake manage feature compatibility?

import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Many Delta Lake optimizations require enabling Delta Lake features on a table. Delta Lake features are always backwards compatible, so tables written by a lower Delta Lake version can always be read and written by a higher Delta Lake version. Enabling some features breaks forward compatibility with workloads running in a lower Delta Lake version. For features that break forward compatibility, you must update all workloads that reference the upgraded tables to use a compliant Delta Lake version.

## What Delta Lake features require client upgrades?

The following Delta Lake features break forward compatibility. Features are enabled on a table-by-table basis.

## What is a table protocol specification?

Every Delta table has a protocol specification which indicates the set of features that the table supports. The protocol specification is used by applications that read or write the table to determine if they can handle all the features that the table supports. If an application does not know how to handle a feature that is listed as supported in the protocol of a table, then that application is not be able to read or write that table.

The protocol specification is separated into two components: the _read protocol_ and the _write protocol_.

### Read protocol

The read protocol lists all features that a table supports and that an application must understand in order to read the table correctly. Upgrading the read protocol of a table requires that all reader applications support the added features.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
All applications that write to a Delta table must be able to construct a snapshot of the table. As such, workloads that write to Delta tables must respect both reader and writer protocol requirements.

If you encounter a protocol that is unsupported by a workload on Delta Lake, you must upgrade to a higher Delta Lake implementation with more comprehensive support.

</Aside>

### Write protocol

The write protocol lists all features that a table supports and that an application must understand in order to write to the table correctly. Upgrading the write protocol of a table requires that all writer applications support the added features. It does not affect read-only applications, unless the read protocol is also upgraded.

## Which protocols must be upgraded?

Some features require upgrading both the read protocol and the write protocol. Other features only require upgrading the write protocol.

As an example, support for `CHECK` constraints is a write protocol feature: only writing applications need to know about `CHECK` constraints and enforce them.

In contrast, column mapping requires upgrading both the read and write protocols. Because the data is stored differently in the table, reader applications must understand column mapping so they can read the data correctly.

For more on upgrading, see [Upgrading protocol versions](#upgrading-protocol-versions).

## What are table features?

In Delta Lake 2.3.0 and above, Delta Lake table features introduce granular flags specifying which features are supported by a given table. Table features are the successor to protocol versions and are designed with the goal of improved flexibility for clients that read and write Delta Lake. See [What is a protocol version?](#what-is-a-protocol-version).

<Aside type="note">
  Table features have protocol version requirements. See [Features by protocol
  version](#features-by-protocol-version).
</Aside>

A Delta table feature is a marker that indicates that the table supports a particular feature. Every feature is either a write protocol feature (meaning it only upgrades the write protocol) or a read/write protocol feature (meaning both read and write protocols are upgraded to enable the feature).

To learn more about supported table features in Delta Lake, see the [Delta Lake protocol](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#valid-feature-names-in-table-features).

## Do table features change how Delta Lake features are enabled?

If you only interact with Delta tables through Delta Lake, you can continue to track support for Delta Lake features using minimum Delta Lake requirements. If you read and write from Delta tables using other systems, you might need to consider how table features impact compatibility, because there is a risk that the system could not understand the upgraded protocol versions.

## What is a protocol version?

A protocol version is a protocol number that indicates a particular grouping of table features. In Delta Lake 2.3.0 and below, you cannot enable table features individually. Protocol versions bundle a group of features.

Delta tables specify a separate protocol version for read protocol and write protocol. The transaction log for a Delta table contains protocol versioning information that supports Delta Lake evolution.

The protocol versions bundle all features from previous protocols. See [Features by protocol version](#features-by-protocol-version).

<Aside type="note">
  Starting with writer version 7 and reader version 3, Delta Lake has introduced
  the concept of table features. Using table features, you can now choose to
  only enable those features that are supported by other clients in your data
  ecosystem. See [What are table features?](#what-are-table-features).
</Aside>

## Features by protocol version

## Upgrading protocol versions

You can choose to manually update a table to a newer protocol version. We recommend using the lowest protocol versions that support the Delta Lake features required for your table. Upgrading the writer protocol might cause less disruption than upgrading the reader protocol since systems and workloads using older Delta Lake versions can still read from tables, even if they do not support the updated writer protocol.

<Aside
  type="caution"
  title="Warning"
>
  Protocol version upgrades are irreversible, and upgrading the protocol version
  might break the existing Delta Lake table readers, writers, or both. We
  recommend you upgrade specific tables only when needed, such as to opt-in to
  new features in Delta Lake. You should also check to make sure that all of
  your current and future production tools support Delta Lake tables with the
  new protocol version.
</Aside>

To upgrade a table to a newer protocol version, use the `DeltaTable.upgradeTableProtocol` method:

<Tabs syncKey="code-examples">
  <TabItem label="SQL">
    ```sql
    -- Upgrades the reader protocol version to 1 and the writer protocol version to 3.
    ALTER TABLE <table_identifier> SET TBLPROPERTIES('delta.minReaderVersion' = '1', 'delta.minWriterVersion' = '3')
    ```
  </TabItem>

<TabItem label="Python">
  ```python 
  from delta.tables import DeltaTable delta =
  DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "path_to_table") # or DeltaTable.forName
  delta.upgradeTableProtocol(1, 3) # upgrades to readerVersion=1,
  writerVersion=3 
  ```
</TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Scala">
    ```scala
    import io.delta.tables.DeltaTable
    val delta = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "path_to_table") // or DeltaTable.forName
    delta.upgradeTableProtocol(1, 3) // Upgrades to readerVersion=1, writerVersion=3.
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
