# Delta Lake

[Delta Lake](https://delta.io) is an open source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes. Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing. Delta Lake runs on top of your existing data lake and is fully compatible with Apache Spark APIs.

This PyPi package contains the Python APIs for using Delta Lake with Apache Spark.
