/**
 * Represents a transaction to mutate a Delta table.
 *
 * <p>This interface will eventually replace the {@link Transaction} interface, and differs from its
 * predecessor in that {@link TransactionV2} no longer directly controls how a commit is performed.
 * It exposes the {@link CommitContext} (actions to commit, additional commit metadata) that engines
 * may use to have better control over the commit process. This has a several benefits:
 *
 * <p><b>Enhanced Engine Control:</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Engines can now directly control if the {@code finalizedActions} to commit are materialized
 *       or kept as a one-time-only iterator. Note that these actions must be materialized in order
 *       to support retries.
 *   <li>Engines can now directly control retry logic, e.g. to perform exponential backoff.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Catalog Integration:</b>
 *
 * <p>Engines can use the {@link CommitContext} to provide the necessary inputs to the {@link
 * io.delta.kernel.commit.Committer#commit} method, which is then responsible for the commit. This
 * is particularly important for catalog-managed tables, where the {@link
 * io.delta.kernel.commit.Committer} may perform catalog-specific operations during the commit. Some
 * examples of this include:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>writing actions into staged commit files instead of directly into the `_delta_log`
 *   <li>sending commits inline to the catalog
 *   <li>publishing previously-ratified commits
 *   <li>sending additional commit metadata to the catalog, such as the latest schema, latest table
 *       properties, commit timestamp, and more
 * </ul>
