 * A timestamp type, supporting [0001-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z, 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999Z] where the
 * left/right-bound is a date and time of the proleptic Gregorian calendar in UTC+00:00. Internally,
 * this is represented as the number of microseconds since the Unix epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
 *
 * <p>Due to historical reasons timestamp partition columns do not store timezone information.
