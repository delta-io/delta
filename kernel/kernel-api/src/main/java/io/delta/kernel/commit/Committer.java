   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>Writing the finalized actions into a staged commit file
   *   <li>Calling catalog commit APIs with the staged commit location (or inline content) and
   *       additional metadata (such as the commit Protocol and Metadata)
   *   <li>Publishing ratified catalog commits into the Delta log
   * </ol>
   *

   * @param finalizedActions the iterator of finalized actions to be committed, taken from {@link
   *     CommitContext#getFinalizedActions()}. Callers must either
   *     <ul>
   *       <li>Pass the iterator directly from the {@link CommitContext} into this call site
   *       <li>First materialize the iterator contents (e.g., into a {@link java.util.List}) and
   *           then create a new iterator from the materialized data
   *     </ul>
   *
   * @param commitMetadata the {@link CommitMetadata} associated with this commit, which contains
   *     additional metadata required to commit the finalized actions to the table, such as the
   *     commit version, Delta log path, and more.
   * @return CommitResponse containing the resultant commit
   * @throws CommitFailedException if the commit operation fails
