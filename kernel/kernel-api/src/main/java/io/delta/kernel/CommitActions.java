/**
 * Represents all actions from a single commit version in a table.

 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each iterator returned by {@link #getActions()} must be closed after use to release
 *       underlying resources.
 *   <li>The {@code CommitActions} object should be closed correctly (preferably using
 *       try-with-resources) to ensure any resources allocated during construction are properly
 *       released.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (CommitActions commitActions = ...) {

 *   long timestamp = commitActions.getTimestamp();
 *
 *   try (CloseableIterator<ColumnarBatch> actions = commitActions.getActions()) {
