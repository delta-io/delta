/**
 * Represents a Delta table resolved to a specific version.

 * <p>A {@code ResolvedTable} is a snapshot of a Delta table at a specific point in time, identified
 * by a version number. It provides access to the table's metadata, schema, and capabilities for
 * both reading and writing data. This interface is the result of resolving a table through a {@link
 * ResolvedTableBuilder} and serves as the entry point for table operations.
 *
 * <p>The resolved table represents a consistent view of the table at the resolved version. All
 * operations on this table will see the same data and metadata, ensuring consistency across reads
 * and writes.
