/**
 * Represents a snapshot of a Delta table at a specific version.
 *
 * <p>A {@code Snapshot} is a consistent view of a Delta table at a specific point in time,
 * identified by a version number. It provides access to the table's metadata, schema, and
 * capabilities for both reading and writing data. This interface serves as the entry point for
 * table operations after resolving a table through a {@link SnapshotBuilder}.
 *
 * <p>The snapshot represents a consistent view of the table at the resolved version. All operations
 * on this snapshot will see the same data and metadata, ensuring consistency across reads and
 * writes within the same snapshot.
 *
 * <p>There are two ways to create a {@code Snapshot}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>New API (recommended):</b> Use {@link TableManager#loadSnapshot(String)} to get a {@link
 *       SnapshotBuilder}, which can then be configured and built into a snapshot
 *   <li><b>Legacy API:</b> Use {@code Table.forPath(path)} followed by methods like {@code
 *       getLatestSnapshot()}, {@code getSnapshotAtTimestamp()}, etc.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @since 3.0.0
