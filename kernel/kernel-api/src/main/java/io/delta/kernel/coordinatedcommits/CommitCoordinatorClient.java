/**
 * The CommitCoordinatorClient is responsible for communicating with the commit coordinator and

 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #registerTable}: Determine the table config during commit coordinator registration.
 *   <li>{@link #commit}: Commit a new version of the table.
 *   <li>{@link #getCommits}: Tracks and returns unbackfilled commits.
 *   <li>{@link #backfillToVersion}: Ensure that commits are backfilled if/when needed.
 * </ul>

   * coordinated-commit table.
   *

   * and the upgrade commit needs to be a file system commit which will write the backfilled file
   * directly.
   *

   * @param logPath The path to the delta log of the table that should be converted.
   * @param tableIdentifier The table identifier for the table, or {@link Optional#empty()} if the
   *     table doesn't use any identifier (i.e. it is path-based).
   * @param currentVersion The version of the table just before conversion. currentVersion + 1
   *     represents the commit that will do the conversion. This must be backfilled atomically.
   *     currentVersion + 2 represents the first commit after conversion. This will go through the
   *     CommitCoordinatorClient and the client is free to choose when it wants to backfill this
   *     commit.

   * @return A map of key-value pairs which is issued by the commit coordinator to uniquely identify
   *     the table. This should be stored in the table's metadata for table property {@link

   *     needs to be passed to the {@link #commit}, {@link #getCommits}, and {@link
