   *   <li><b>Add columns:</b> New columns can be added at any position
   *   <li><b>Rename columns:</b> Change the logical name while preserving the physical name
   *   <li><b>Type widening:</b> Compatible type changes (e.g., int to long)

   *   <li><b>Drop columns:</b> Remove columns (with restrictions)
