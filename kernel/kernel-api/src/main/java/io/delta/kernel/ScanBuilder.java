   *
   * <p>Kernel makes use of the scan file partition values (for partitioned tables) and file-level
   * column statistics (min, max, null count etc.) in the Delta metadata for filtering. Sometimes
   * these metadata is not enough to deterministically say a scan file doesn't contain data that
   * satisfies the filter.
   *
   * <p>E.g. given filter is {@code a = 2}. In file A, column {@code a} has min value as -40 and max
   * value as 200. In file B, column {@code a} has min value as 78 and max value as 323. File B can
   * be ruled out as it cannot possibly have rows where `a = 2`, but file A cannot be ruled out as
   * it may contain rows where {@code a = 2}.
   *
   * <p>As filtering is a best effort, the {@link Scan} object may return scan files (through {@link
   * Scan#getScanFiles(Engine)}) that does not satisfy the filter. It is the responsibility of the
   * caller to apply the remaining filter returned by {@link Scan#getRemainingFilter()} to the data
   * read from the scan files (returned by {@link Scan#getScanFiles(Engine)}) to completely filter
   * out the data that doesn't satisfy the filter.```
