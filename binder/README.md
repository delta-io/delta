# Delta Lake Binder

A binder and docker deployment of Spark with Delta Lake

Note that the [docker option](../quickstart_containers) enables comprhensive exploration of all the features of the Delta Lake Quickstart, whereas the binder option is convenient, but requires some workarounds to the Delta Lake Quickstart.  Both workflows have been captured in notebooks present in the respective deployments.
