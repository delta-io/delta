  /**
   * Searches for the latest commit with the timestamp, which has happened at or before `time` in

   *  1. We use Spark to list our commit history in parallel `maxKeysPerList` at a time.
   *  2. We then perform our search in each fragment of commits containing at most `maxKeysPerList`
   *     elements.
   *  3. All fragments that are before `time` will return the last commit in the fragment.
   *  4. All fragments that are after `time` will exit early and return the first commit in the
   *     fragment.
   *  5. The fragment that contains the version we are looking for will return the version we are
   *     looking for.
   *  6. Once all the results are returned from Spark, we make sure that the commit timestamps are
   *     monotonically increasing across the fragments, because we couldn't adjust for the
   *     boundaries when working in parallel.
   *  7. We then return the version we are looking for in this smaller list on the Driver.
   * We will return the first available commit if the condition cannot be met. This method works
   * even for boundary commits, and can be best demonstrated through an example:
   * Imagine we have commits 999, 1000, 1001, 1002. t_999 < t_1000 but t_1000 > t_1001 and
   * t_1001 < t_1002. So at the the boundary, we will need to eventually adjust t_1001. Assume the
   * result needs to be t_1001 after the adjustment as t_search < t_1002 and t_search > t_1000.
   * What will happen is that the first fragment will return t_1000, and the second fragment will
   * return t_1001. On the Driver, we will adjust t_1001 = t_1000 + 1 milliseconds, and our linear
   * search will return t_1001.
   *
   * Placed in the static object to avoid serializability issues.

   * An iterator that helps select old log files for deletion. It takes the input iterator of log

   * than maxTimestamp or maxVersion if it finds that files that need to be preserved for adjusting
   * the timestamps of subsequent files. Let's go through an example. Assume the following commit
   * history:
   *
   * +---------+-----------+--------------------+
   * | Version | Timestamp | Adjusted Timestamp |
   * +---------+-----------+--------------------+
   * |       0 |         0 |                  0 |
   * |       1 |         5 |                  5 |

   * +---------+-----------+--------------------+
   *
   * As you can see from the example, we require timestamps to be monotonically increasing with
   * respect to the version of the commit, and each commit to have a unique timestamp. If we have
   * a commit which doesn't obey one of these two requirements, we adjust the timestamp of that
   * commit to be one millisecond greater than the previous commit.
   *
   * Given the above commit history, the behavior of this iterator will be as follows:
   *  - For maxVersion = 1 and maxTimestamp = 9, we can delete versions 0 and 1
   *  - Until we receive maxVersion >= 4 and maxTimestamp >= 12, we can't delete versions 2 and 3.
   *    This is because version 2 is used to adjust the timestamps of commits up to version 4.
   *  - For maxVersion >= 5 and maxTimestamp >= 14 we can delete everything
   * The semantics of time travel guarantee that for a given timestamp, the user will ALWAYS get the
   * same version. Consider a user asks to get the version at timestamp 11. If all files are there,
   * we would return version 3 (timestamp 11) for this query. If we delete versions 0-2, the
   * original timestamp of version 3 (7) will not have an anchor to adjust on, and if the time
   * travel query is re-executed we would return version 4. This is the motivation behind this
   * iterator implementation.
   *
   * The implementation maintains an internal "maybeDelete" buffer of files that we are unsure of
   * deleting because they may be necessary to adjust time of future files. For each file we get
   * from the underlying iterator, we check whether it needs time adjustment or not. If it does need
   * time adjustment, then we cannot immediately decide whether it is safe to delete that file or
   * not and therefore we put it in each the buffer. Then we iteratively peek ahead at the future
   * files and accordingly decide whether to delete all the buffered files or retain them.
   *
   * @param underlying The iterator which gives the list of files in ascending version order
   * @param maxTimestamp The timestamp until which we can delete (inclusive).
   * @param maxVersion The version until which we can delete (inclusive).
   * @param versionGetter A method to get the commit version from the file path.
