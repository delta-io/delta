/**
 * A base class for all table features.
 *
 * A feature can be <b>explicitly supported</b> by a table's protocol when the protocol contains a
 * feature's `name`. Writers (for writer-only features) or readers and writers (for reader-writer
 * features) must recognize supported features and must handle them appropriately.
 *
 * A table feature that released before Delta Table Features (reader version 3 and writer version
 * 7) is considered as a <b>legacy feature</b>. Legacy features are <b>implicitly supported</b>
 * when (a) the protocol does not support table features, i.e., has reader version less than 3 or
 * writer version less than 7 and (b) the feature's minimum reader/writer version is less than or
 * equal to the current protocol's reader/writer version.
 *
 * Separately, a feature can be automatically supported by a table's metadata when certain
 * feature-specific table properties are set. For example, `changeDataFeed` is automatically
 * supported when there's a table property `delta.enableChangeDataFeed=true`. This is independent
 * of the table's enabled features. When a feature is supported (explicitly or implicitly) by the
 * table protocol but its metadata requirements are not satisfied, then clients still have to
 * understand the feature (at least to the extent that they can read and preserve the existing
 * data in the table that uses the feature). See the documentation of
 * [[FeatureAutomaticallyEnabledByMetadata]] for more information.
 *
 * @param name
 *   a globally-unique string indicator to represent the feature. All characters must be letters
 *   (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), '-', or '_'. Words must be in camelCase.
 * @param minReaderVersion
 *   the minimum reader version this feature requires. For a feature that can only be explicitly
 *   supported, this is either `0` or `3` (the reader protocol version that supports table
 *   features), depending on the feature is writer-only or reader-writer. For a legacy feature
 *   that can be implicitly supported, this is the first protocol version which the feature is
 *   introduced.
 * @param minWriterVersion
 *   the minimum writer version this feature requires. For a feature that can only be explicitly
 *   supported, this is the writer protocol `7` that supports table features. For a legacy feature
 *   that can be implicitly supported, this is the first protocol version which the feature is
 *   introduced.

/**
 * A trait indicating a feature can be removed. Classes that extend the trait need to
 * implement the following four functions:
 *
 * a) preDowngradeCommand. This is where all required actions for removing the feature are
 *    implemented. For example, to remove the DVs feature we need to remove metadata config
 *    and purge all DVs from table. This action takes place before the protocol downgrade in
 *    separate commit(s). Note, the command needs to be implemented in a way concurrent
 *    transactions do not nullify the effect. For example, disabling DVs on a table before
 *    purging will stop concurrent transactions from adding DVs. During protocol downgrade
 *    we perform a validation in [[validateRemoval]] to make sure all invariants still hold.
 *
 * b) validateRemoval. Add any feature-specific checks before proceeding to the protocol
 *    downgrade. This function is guaranteed to be called at the latest version before the
 *    protocol downgrade is committed to the table. When the protocol downgrade txn conflicts,
 *    the validation is repeated against the winning txn snapshot. As soon as the protocol
 *    downgrade succeeds, all subsequent interleaved txns are aborted.
 *    The implementation should return true if there are no feature traces in the latest
 *    version. False otherwise.
 *
 * c) requiresHistoryTruncation. It indicates whether the table history needs to be clear
 *    of all feature traces before downgrading the protocol. This is by default true
 *    for all reader+writer features and false for writer features.
 *    WARNING: Disabling [[requiresHistoryTruncation]] for relevant features could result to
 *    incorrect snapshot reconstruction.
 *
 * d) actionUsesFeature. For features that require history truncation we verify whether past
 *    versions contain any traces of the removed feature. This is achieved by calling
 *    [[actionUsesFeature]] for every action of every reachable commit version in the log.
 *    Note, a feature may leave traces in both data and metadata. Depending on the feature, we
 *    need to check several types of actions such as Metadata, AddFile, RemoveFile etc.
 *
 *    WARNING: actionUsesFeature should not check Protocol actions for the feature being removed,
 *    because at the time actionUsesFeature is invoked the protocol downgrade did not happen yet.
 *    Thus, the feature-to-remove is still active. As a result, any unrelated operations that
 *    produce a protocol action (while we are waiting for the retention period to expire) will
 *    "carry" the feature-to-remove. Checking protocol for that feature would result in an
 *    unnecessary failure during the history validation of the next DROP FEATURE call. Note,
 *    while the feature-to-remove is supported in the protocol we cannot generate a legit protocol
 *    action that adds support for that feature since it is already supported.

 * This table feature represents support for column DEFAULT values for Delta Lake. With this
 * feature, it is possible to assign default values to columns either at table creation time or
 * later by using commands of the form: ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN c SET DEFAULT v. Thereafter,
 * queries from the table will return the specified default value instead of NULL when the
 * corresponding field is not present in storage.
 *
 * We create this as a writer-only feature rather than a reader/writer feature in order to simplify
 * the query execution implementation for scanning Delta tables. This means that commands of the
 * following form are not allowed: ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN c DEFAULT v. The reason is that when
 * commands of that form execute (such as for other data sources like CSV or JSON), then the data
 * source scan implementation must take responsibility to return the supplied default value for all
 * rows, including those previously present in the table before the command executed. We choose to
 * avoid this complexity for Delta table scans, so we make this a writer-only feature instead.
 * Therefore, the analyzer can take care of the entire job when processing commands that introduce
 * new rows into the table by injecting the column default value (if present) into the corresponding
 * query plan. This comes at the expense of preventing ourselves from easily adding a default value
 * to an existing non-empty table, because all data files would need to be rewritten to include the
 * new column value in an expensive backfill.
