/**
 * A type widening mode captures a specific set of type changes that are allowed to be applied.
 * Currently:
 *  - NoTypeWidening: No type change is allowed.
 *  - AllTypeWidening: Allows widening to the target type using any supported type change.
 *  - TypeEvolution: Only allows widening to the target type if the type change is eligible to be
 *      applied automatically during schema evolution.
 *  - AllTypeWideningToCommonWiderType: Allows widening to a common (possibly different) wider type
 *      using any supported type change.
 *  - TypeEvolutionToCommonWiderType: Allows widening to a common (possibly different) wider type
 *      using only type changes that are eligible to be applied automatically during schema
 *      evolution.
 *
 * TypeEvolution modes can be restricted to only type changes supported by Iceberg by passing
 * `uniformIcebergCompatibleOnly = truet`, to ensure that we don't automatically apply a type change
 * that would break Iceberg compatibility.
