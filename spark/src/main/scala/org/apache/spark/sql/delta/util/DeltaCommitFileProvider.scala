/**
 * Provides access to resolve Delta commit files names based on the commit-version.
 *
 * This class is part of the changes introduced to accommodate the adoption of coordinated-commits
 * in Delta Lake. Previously, certain code paths assumed the existence of delta files for a specific
 * version at a predictable path `_delta_log/$version.json`. With coordinated-commits, delta files
 * may alternatively be located at `_delta_log/_commits/$version.$uuid.json`.
 * DeltaCommitFileProvider attempts to locate the correct delta files from the Snapshot's
 * LogSegment.
 *
 * @param logPath The path to the Delta table log directory.
 * @param maxVersionInclusive The maximum version of the Delta table (inclusive).
 * @param uuids A map of version numbers to their corresponding UUIDs.
