/**
 * Test suite for removing column mapping(CM) from a table with CDC enabled. Test different
 * scenarios with respect to table schema at different points of time. There are a few events we
 * are interested in: UP: enable column mapping DOWN: disable column mapping RE, DROP: rename,
 * drop a column
 *
 * And there are two parameters for reading CDC: START: starting version END: ending version
 *
 * We test all the possible combinations of these events and parameters.
